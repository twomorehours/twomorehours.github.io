- Hey Chelsea, there's a big `comedy festival` this weekend. `Wanna go`?

- `Sounds fun`, Is it all `stand-up`?

- No, they've got `improv` and `sketch comedy` as well.

- Cool! Any famous performers `in the lineup`?

- `Ever` `heard of` Kevin Hart and Jerry Seinfeld?

- Wow, but they're probably just going to `recycle the old material`.
  
- `In that case`, we can `check out` some of more local comedians.

- `I'd be into that`. `Smaller crowds` are more `intimate`.

- But also more `hecklers`.

- `Nothing a witty comedian can't hanle`.
