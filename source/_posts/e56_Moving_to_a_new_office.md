- A: Morning, `look at` our new office.

- B: Morning, bro. Wow, we finally have our own `studio`.

- C: `Morning guys`. 

- B: Hey, Diana. `come check out` our new studio. 

- C: Oh, I like it. It's nice. But I `kind of` miss the old studio. `So many memories there`. 

- A: That's right. But I don't miss the `commute`. It's just `so handy` to have a studio right in our office. 
  
- B: `Seems` we have `brand new equipment`,too. These mics `look nice`.

- C: Yeah, I feel like `I'm a radio star sitting behind them`. 

- A: Guys, let's `get out of here`. `I'm starting to feel a bit` claustrophobic.

- C: `By the way`, do you know where you're sitting?

- A: Maybe we could just `hot the desk from this large table`.

- B: Oh, `that'll be awesome`! Hey, how did you `get in here`? `I don't think I've got my access card yet`. 

- A: I got mime last Friday. Just `double-check with Xiao Wei`. `I'm pretty sure` she's got yours.

- B: Ok. `What are these bags for`?

- C:  I think they `absorb the smell of construction materials`. But let's open all the windows to `air the place out`.
