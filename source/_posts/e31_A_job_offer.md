- A: Hi jeremy. `Have you given more thought to` the job offer?

- B: Absolutely. It's a very `generous` offer, but `I do have some quest ions and cocerns`.
  
- A: Okay, `what in particular`? Is it the `annual leave`?

- B: No, `I'm happy with` `two weeks of paid vacation`. `The issue is` the `salary structure`. The `base salary` `is lower than I expected`.

- A: Yes, it `is heavy on` `performance bonus`. We can probably `adjust that for you`. Just `send me a number` and I'll `forward it to` HR.

- B: Thanks. `That'd be great`. Also, `are there any opportunities for personal development` `included in` the `compensation package`?

- A: `There is`. We `provide support for` `continuing education programs`, `skill-based training`, as well as `conferences` and `seminars`. `Anything else`?

- B: No, `anything else looks great`. `I'm really excited to` `join the team`.

- A: Okay, I'll `get HR to` `draw up` a new `contract`.
