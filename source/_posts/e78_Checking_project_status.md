- A:  Ok, let's get started. `Why don't you start with` `quick status update`?

- B:  Sure. `In general`, `we're in the great shape on` `the tech side of things`. Both the website and mobile apps are looking good and `will be ready for launch` `by target date`. I also `brought in a market assistant` last week and have been `getting her up to speed`.

- A: Alright. I know the tech side looks good, but in my experience, `somthing always goes wrong` `during this phase`.Make sure you `allocate adequate resources` for testing.

- B: Got it. `Moving on to` the new clients. I've met 4 out of 7 new leads Bl brought in. `They're all pretty eager` to try our solutions.  So I'll be setting them up with trial accounts this week.

- A: Sounds goods. Now `have you heard anything from` the hotel chain? 

- B: `The person I was talking to` has been on holiday for a few weeks. `I'll follow up` again this week.

- A: To be honest, `this has been dragging on for too long`. If you feel the lead is dead, then let's not `waste time persuing it anymore`.

- B: Sure. `In that case`, `I'll put them on the backburner`. Also, `I wanted to ask you about the possibility of` `bringing in` one more person to help with branding. `The team is spread pretty thin` right now.

- A: I thought that's why you hired the marketing assistant. `Can't she be resiponsible for that`? 

- B: `My concern is that` `she's still pretty inexperienced`. I mean she's very smart girl. But `I don't think she will be able to come up with` a high level concept or strategy.

- A: To be honest, `this should be our job`. We should come up with a plan for her to execute. But I want to get Nick's input as well. Let's `set aside some time later today to` discuss it.

- B: Sounds good.
