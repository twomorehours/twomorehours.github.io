- A: `Can I talk to you for a minute`?

- B: Sure. `What's up?`

- A: `I have a bit of an issue`. I know you were `expecting those reports` to be on your desk tommorow morning. And I do realize you `gave me a deadline`, but ...

- B: Oh, `what happened`?

- A: Well, you see. I've had `a lot of unexpected problems` come up. `I've had to deal with a few factors that I could never foresee`.

- B: Ok, `like what`?
  
- A: Even though I asked Market Research team to get `the figures` to me by noon today, `they told me they're behind schedule`. And `to top it off`, David has been `slacking off` all week. Although he's usually my most dependable guy, `I'm on the verge of` writing him up.

- B: Ok, `calm down`. First of all,  as Project Manager, `you are responsible for overseeing your team`. `If you are having issue with them`, you should `work with HR `so that they can help you `straighten them out`.

- A: `I know. I understand that`. I'm just scrambling to `get everything finished on time`.  but I can `assure you that` `I'll get this taken care of ASAP`. 

- B: So `do you think I will` have the reports `by the end of business` tomorrow?

- A: Yes, `I will have them on your desk by 5PM!` I'll `call a meeting with my team `so that `we can all get back on track`. I will even stay late to review the reports with you tomorrow `if that would help`. 

- B: Ok, thank you. In the future, just remember that this is your team, `you are the one calling the shots here`.

- A: Of Course, sir. I `apologize again`.
