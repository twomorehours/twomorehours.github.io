- A: Hey Rd, `do you ever feel like` `we're stuck in` `a  dead-end` job?

- B: I'm pretty satisfied. But `I can see how` a `go-getter` like yourself `is hungry for more`.

- A: Thanks. I'm just `tired of` not being challenged.

- B:` I felt the same way` `when I was your age`. Now `I'm just thankful to` `have job security`.

- A: So `what should I do`? Just `get used to` it?

- B: Heck no. If you want to `climb coporate ladder`, `try further` `developing your skill set` and `up your value`.

- A: I guess I could `take advantage of` those company workshops.

- B: `That's a good start`. You could also `take initial` and `reach out to` your manager about `taking on a greater role`.

- A: You're right. I should `make my ambitions known`.

- B: You should. `Otherwise`, you may `go unnoticed` and miss out on `a promotion`.
