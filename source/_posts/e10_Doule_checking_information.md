- A: Hey, Nick. Could we quickly `go over` the conference material right now?

- A: Great! What's the status of the `posters`?

- B: Those will `be done` and `ready for review` `by the end of today`.

- A: Ok. Do you know `how long it'll take to` print them?

- B: I `got a confirmation from` the printer saying  everything will `be delivered` by next Tuesday `as long as` they receive the designs `by Friday afternoon`.

- A: Great! What about the banners?

- B: They just arrived this morning. And I `double-checked every detail`, `Everything looks good`.

- A: And what about company swag? Do we `have enough lying around`?

- B: Yes we do. We have lots of pens, notebooks, lanyards and tote bags.
