- A: Hi, Paul. `It's nice to finally` speak with you on the phone.

- B: It's nice to speak with you `as well`. `As you mentioned`, you're looking for a `vendor` to `outsource` HR and would like to `know more about` our services.

- A: That's right. Our business is `getting too big` to `handle that alone`.

- B: Well, that's `where a company like ours comes in`. We `specialized in` `end-to-end` payroll managing, `benefits` and staff onboarding.

- A: `That's exactly what we are looking for`.` Could you give me an idea as to` your current client base?

- B: We `specialized in` samll-to-medium businesses. Our clients usually have a headcount between 20 and 200. We're actually the leading vendor in the segment and most of them `come from word of mouth`.

- A: That sounds great. `How do you charge for your services`?

- B: We `charge per` employee and it's a tired structure, meaning the `more the employees, the greater the discount`.

- A: That sounds great. We currently hava 80 employees. Could I get a `quote`?

- B: For sure. I'll do it `right away`.
