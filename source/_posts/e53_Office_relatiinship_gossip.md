- A: Oh my god, did you see Julia from sales just `walk by`? She's really `let herself go`.

- B: What? `You didn't know`? She's pregnent.

- A: `No way`. I didn't know she was married.

- B: Who said she was. Well, `you didn't hear this from me`, but `she's been messing around with` Richard.

- A: Oh my god. Richard? The fianance director? Now you mention it, `I've noticed them making eyes at each other` at meetings. They're propably `playing footsie` under the table.

- B: It just really `rubs me the wrong way` because Richard oversees budgeting and he has been treating Julia `preferentially` ever since. `He has practically green lighted everything sha has put forward`.
  
- A: That would also `explain the promotion` that she got `last quarter`. I'm sure Richard `put in a good word for` her. She `vaulted ahead of` a lot of people more senior than her to `get that position`. `Wait`,I thought office romance should be `disclosed`.

- B: `Apparently not` if it involves someone `in upper management`. So much for this place being a `meritocracy`.

- A: Anyways, `we've probably been standing` `at this water` cooler for ten minutes. `I'm going back` to work.

- B: See you later `at your cubicle`.
