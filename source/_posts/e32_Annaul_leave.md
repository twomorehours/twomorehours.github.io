- A: `I'm aware of that`. `I've asked Paul to` `cover some of my responsibilites` `while I' gone`.

- A: `I have complete faith in him`. `Besides`, `he's been looking for opportunites to` `step up` `here at` the office.

- B: Well, `I'd really like to` `accommodate you`, Mark. `Maybe there is some way` `we can meet in the mddile`?

- B: `That sounds a bit more doable`. And `I appreciate` you `giving plenty of notice`. `Would you mind sending me an email` with your dates, `just so I have a copy`?

- A: `I'll get right on it`.
