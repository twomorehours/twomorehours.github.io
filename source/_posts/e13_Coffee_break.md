- A: Hey huys, I'm going to `make a coffee run`. `Anybody want anything`?

- B: I `could use` some `caffeine`, yeah. Where are you going, Starbucks or Luckin?

- A: I `was thinking of` Luckin. They've `got a special promotion going on` `right now`.

- B: OK, cool! Just `get me` a large `Americano` with `two sugar packets` `on the side`, please.

- A: Large Americano, two sugars. No problem. `Anybody else`?

- C: Yeah, pick me up a `capuccino`, if you don't mind. Oh, and a blueberry `muffin`.

- A: Got it. `Do you think Betty will want anything`?

- B: She's not really a `coffee drinker`. Maybe an `herbal tea`.

- A: Ok, sounds good. Anything else? Last chance, everybody?

- C: I think `we're good`, thanks, Tim.
