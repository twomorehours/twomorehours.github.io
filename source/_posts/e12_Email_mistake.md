- A: Oh no.

- B: You alright, James.

- A: I really `messed up`. I just sent our client list to the wrong person.

- B: What? Didn't Cathy tell you to `CC` that to her?

- A: Yes, but I `accidently` sent it to Cathy Wang at Harpers.

- B: Harpers? `as in` our biggest competitor?

- A: Yeah. Oh man, I `feel like such an idiot`.

- B: `There's no point worrying about it`. `It's not the end of the world`.

- A: `It's hopeless`. You can't unsend an email. `I'm in big trouble`.

- B: Cathy Wang is `pretty reasonable`, you can probably `convince her to` delete it.

- A: Well, `it's worth a shot`.
