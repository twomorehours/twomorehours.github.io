- A: I must say, this `is quite the` soiree you `put together`, Great job Carol.

- B: Thanks bill. But I `couldn't have done it without` Eddie: he really `got this thing in motion`. 

- C: Oh, `it was nothing`. Really, `you were the brains behind` the operation, Carol. Bsides, `I should be thanking you two for` another great year at the company. 

- B: `Don't be so modest`, `you worked your butt off for` this event. 

- A: Yeah, and `not just for` this event: you `busted your head all year` Eddie. `I'm honored to have yo on our team.`  

- C: `I'm not used to such praise`. `You guys` are going to `give me a big head`.
  
- A: `Nonsense`. `You've earned it`. Just like `you've earned that promotion` I know you've `had your eyes on`.

- C: Bill, `are you saying what I think you're saying`?

- B: He is. I `put in` a personal `recommendation`. Now, come on,`let's celebrate with` `a couple drinks` and some dancing.
