- A: `Just to be clear`, did you receive all my emails?

- B: Yes, I got about 5 or 6 different emails and `I've already looked through` `all the attachments`.

- A: Ok, well do you have any questions?
  
- B: I do. `Mainly questions concerning my duties and reponsibilities`. Do I need to `contact clients` every week?

- A: We like to `make our clients feel like` `they can commnunicate with us whenever`, so sending a weekly email `reinforeces` the message.

- B: Got it. And will you be making an introduction email or should I just email them myself?

- A: `Don't worry about that`. I'll make an intro email and CC you on it. I'll try to `send it out` to everyone `a week before` I leave. By the way, did you receive my 26 `sales contracts`?

- B: Yes, I did.

- A: Great. I'll also `send you some files` on my sales leads. `I would sugguest` just cold calling them. 

- B: Thanks.

- A: Now, here's a paper copy of my day-to-day activities. I've summarized my daily and weekly goals and what preparation I do in between. You've already received a copy of this via email. `Let me know you have any questions`.

- B: Everything is crystal clear. So, `I hope you don't mind if I ask`, but `why are you leaving?`

- A: `To be frank`, `I really love what I do and the people I work with`, but `I can't stand the long hours`. `I found a new part-time job with another company`. My new office will `be close to` home and I'll get to `spend more time with my kids`.

- B: What a true family man. `I'm the opposite, a total workaholic`. 

- A: `That's exactly what the position requires`... Oh, `before I forget` let me send an email with all my contact details. If you have any questions about anything, just shoot me an email.

- B: I appricate it. Also, thanks for sheduling this handover meeting. You've `been extremly helpful`.
