- A: Brian, `do you have a minute to chat about` the project?

- B: Sure,` what's up`?
  
- A: `I've been` `looking at the analytics` and `it seems like` the project is `running out of steam`. `It might be good to` `consider new direction`.

- B: Oh, `I didn't know that's how you felt`. `I am aware that` `it's been slow going`, but `I feel it's import` to `give it more time`.

- A: `That's a good point`.` You've done a great job` `putting it together`, but `frankly`, `it's getting hard` to `find funding`. 

- B: Thanks, `I appreciate you saying that`, but `as you know`, `it's always been hard to` `find funding`.

- A: `My main concern is that` `this time is different` because we don't `have anything to show for pur work`.

- B: I think `that might be a bit of an overstatement`, `or maybe I just see things diffrently`.

- A: `I fully understand where you are coming from`, but `I don't know if the management is going to share that sentiment`.

- B: I think we `can at least agree on that`.

- A: `What if` we tried `comming up with a contigency plan` just `in case` `things don't work out`?

- B: Okay. `I think I can manage that`.
