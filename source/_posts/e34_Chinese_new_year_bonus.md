- A: Hi Kate, `thanks for coming in`. Let's talk about your annual `performance evaluation` and bonus.

- B: Sure. `Where would you like to start`?

- A: `Let's start with your work`. You `not only` `put in` the most overtime, `but also` `brought in` many new customers.

- B: `It's been a busy year`. I noticed we needed `extra help`, so I decided to `step up`.

- A: `Thank you for being` `so proactive`. `It's been key to` our success.

- B: `My pleasure`. `I'm always happy to` `take on more responsibility`.

- A: Great. Because I want to `put you on` some `bigger projects` next year.

- B: That sounds exciting. `Can't wait to get started`.

- A: `Good to hear`. `To show my gratitude`, I've decided to give you a Chinese New Year bonus.

- B: Wow, `that's so generous of you`. `I really appreciate it`.
