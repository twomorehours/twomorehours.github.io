- A: Hey, Louise. Are you `ordering in` or `going out` `for lunch`.

- B: Oh, I'm eating out but I've really `got to` `eat and run`. I've got a meeting `after lunch`.

- A: If you're `tight on time`, let's just go to the `cafeteria`.

- B: The cafeteria `is kind of getting old`. We could go to that fancy place if you want. `It's got great reviews`.

- A: Hmm, that sounds good. Won't it `be packed`?

- B: Yeah, maybe. How about just `grabbing a sanwich` in the `food court`?

- A: I `feel like something` more `filling`. Let's `check the app`.

- B: Honestly, I'm `fresh out of time`. Can we just `keep it simple`?

- A: Oh, sorry! `Sandwich it is`.

- B: Great! Let's go.
