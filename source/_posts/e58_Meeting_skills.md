- A: Ok, `first of all`, `I want to thank everyone for being here`. I think I know most of you here, but for those who don't know me, I'm Molly, `the coporate trainer here from Ireader Corporarion`.

- A: In today's seminar, `we are going to look at how to hold effective meetings`. `For starters`, to have an effective meeting, we need to `understand the purpose or the objective of the meeting`. 

- A: `There are two major types of meetings` `which can be classified depending on their purpose`. We have information meetings and decision-making meetings. `Within each of these , there are two subsets`. An information meeting can be `either advising and updating or selling`. And a decision-making meeting can be about problem solving or policy and `goal setting`.

- A: Understanding these classification is important because `each kind of meeting should be conducted differently`, After `you've determined what kind of` meeting you need, there are many different elements to asess in order to successfully `carry it out`. Let's take a look at some of these now. 

- A: First of all, you `should think about the number of the atendees` and who should join. For information meetings, this is simple. Any number of people `can be equally effective` and those who should come are those who should know. However, with decision-making meeting,a smaller meeting is `more beneficial`, with no more than 12 people, `with the limited size`, it's important that it only be those people who are `responsible and who can contribute`.

- A: `Other elements to consider` are the communication process and meeting `room setup`. With information meetings, the communication is usually `one way`.  The leader simply speaks to the `participants`. Because of this, a classroom style setup is the most effective, with the participants `facing the front of the room`. 
  
- A: As we now know, decision-making `meetings are significantly smaller`. `There should be more interactive communication between all memebers`. To `facilitate this better`, it's `ideal` to have the participants facing each other in more of a conference style setup.

- A: Planing and preparation is very import with information meetings. `The emphasis should be on` the content and your answer to potential questions. With decision-making meetings, the focus is more about the actual interaction and problem solving. Therefore , the key to success is to ensure the meeting environment supports open, free expression.

- A: Finally, it's important to remember that `this isn't completely black and white`. Sometimes a meeting could combine both types. In thos case, you might have to start the meeting on way and end it another. And `that's totally fine`.

- A: Now, to conclude, I'd like to open it up to any questions you may have. But first, can anyone tell me what kind of meeting this was?
