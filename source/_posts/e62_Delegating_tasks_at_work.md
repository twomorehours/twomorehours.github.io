- A: Morning everyone. As `you are all aware`, we're `launching a new product` next month. Today I want to `clarify the roles and responsibilities in our department` so that `we can fully prepare for the launch`. `I'd like to delegate tasks` and responsibilities and `clarify expectations`.

- A: First, let's `start with communications`, Justin, `you're responsible for both external and internal communications`. Please `make sure that customer and media relations are taken care of` and `keep the company internally informed about` the `features and functions` of the new product.

- B: Got it. I'll get started with media outreach today. I'll also `draft a newsletter` `informing our customers of` the product launch. 

- A: Please also include a `trial offer` in the newsletter. Next we have `customer support`, `which falls under Ray`. Ray `I'd like for you to get started with support materials`. Prepare yourself for an influx of inqueries `in the coming month`. `I'm going to need you to work weekends` to `cover the support shift`.

- C: Sure. No problem. 
  
- A: Ok, then we have graphic and web design. `Tom you've started working on a new landing page` for the product launch already.

- D: Yes, `I'll get that to you bu Thursday`. The product info `needs to be updated` on `a bunch of places` `on the site`.

- A: That's right. Justin, can you `help Tom with coming up` that list?

- B: Certainly.

- A: Ok guys. `I think this is a great start`. I realize we've all `got a lot on our plates`, but I hope that by clarafying everyone's roles and `hashing out these details`. We can have a `smooth,successful and fun launch`. `Please feel free to` `drop by my office` `if you have any questions`.  

- A: Oh, and lastly, Ray, `can you send me the meeting notes`? `The action items need to be drawn up with your names` `next to each` too please. These are exceting times. Let's get started.
