- A: Hey T. `I wanted to talk to you about something`.

- B: Sure, what's up?

- A: You know those `graphics` you `sent out to` the boss that he later mentioned during the `morning meeting`? `It was my job to` make them.

- B: `What are you talking about`? 

- A: When we had the `brainstorming session with our project team` `the other day`, they had `delegated the task to` me, but you `went ahead` and made them anyway.

- B: I just saw that they hadn't been made yet. And `I didn't want our pressentation to be incomplete`.

- A: I had already finished the graphics, I was just `waiting until that morning to` send them out.

- B: Oh on. I'm sorry. I didn't `mean to go behind your back and steal you thunder`, especially with your `opportunity for that big promotion` coming up. 

- A: Thanks. And it's alright. I know `you didn't do it on purpose`. But I really want to `make sure this kind of stuff doesn't happen again`.

- B: You got it. I'll definitely reach out to the team before doing something on my own like this. I don't want to `make any mistakes in` rolling out the proposal, but `I also need to remember that` this is a `team effort`.

- A: `Thanks for your understanding`. Now `how in the world` `did you get your graphics to` look so good?
