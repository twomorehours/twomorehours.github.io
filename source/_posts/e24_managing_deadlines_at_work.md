- A: Hey, Daryl. How are you `settling into the new position`?

- B: It' great, thanks. But I'm `juggling so many tight deadlines`.

- A: `I hear you`. I've learned to accept the deadline and stick to it. If the work is `as good as` you can make it, just hit send.

- B: Yeah, `that's a good mindset`. But `there's just so much pressure`.

- A: Don't let that `stress you out`. You can `get a lot more work done` if you're calm `under pressure`.

- B: That's true. `In my last job`, I liked to `broke up deadlines into smaller parts`, like little `milestones`. `It helped`.

- A: Yeah,` mapping out` a `timeline` helps you `stay on track`.

- B: I also `thought of` giving my team a soft dealine. `What do you think`?

- A: That's a good idea. Setting a soft dealine a few days `in advance` gives you time to fix any problems.

- B: That's a great point. `How did you get so good at this`?

- A: Well, I `took on` a lot of impossible deadlines, so I learned `some tricks`. Maybe the biggest one is to just say "no" before `committing to the unrealistic deadline`. 

- B: Hmm, `I don't want to be known for` `rush jobs`.

- A: Exactly! `That used to be me`!
