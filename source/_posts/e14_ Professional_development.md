- A: Peter, I find professional development is `so important for` my job.

- B: Same. `Times are changing`. The `core skills` you learn in university aren't enough.

- A: Exactly. How do you `stay at up to date for` you job? Do you `attend seminars`?

- B: Yeah. Those and `workshops`. They're great ways to `deveop new skills and techniques`.

- A: True. I `mainly` do some `self-studying`. I'm always reading about `industry developments and trends`.

- B: `That's smart`. Online courses are also `a conveninet way to` `stay ahead`.

- A: My company actually offers `free trainning programs` with `mentors`. But `it's expected` that you do them `on your own time`.

- B: Interesting. Yeah, companies should `invest in` their emplyees more. `It's a win-win`.

- A: I agree. But `to be honest`, I `learn so much on` my job. 

- B: Yes, me too. Sometimes the office `is the best classroom`.
