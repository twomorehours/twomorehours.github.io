- A: Hey, Sherry. So what's `working in` `digital marketing` like?

- B: Well, as I'm sure `you can imagine`, `it's a bit different from` traditional marketing.

- A: `I bet`. So, `I take it` digital marketing uses different strategies?

- B: `Big time`. For example, we're able to use `data collection` to create more `personalized` ads.

- A: I got those `in my inbox` all the time. It must be easier to analyse your `target audience` then.

 - B: `Way easier`. We can `identify` all kinds of `buyer trends and patterns`.

- A: That's interesting. `What other strategies are there`? Social marketing?

- B: Yeah, `that's a big one`. Search engine and pay-per-click are `big two`.

- A: So `how effective are` the all these different strategies?

- B: Honestly, each strategy has `cases of successful` and `unsuccessful campains`.
