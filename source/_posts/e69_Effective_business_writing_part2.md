- A: Hello. Today `we're continuing` `our pressentation on` Effective Business writing. `For all of those` weren't here for part one, my name is Diana, and I'm from Economics Department at JR University.Today `we'll be talking about ways` to make business writng effective `in the fast-paced world of Business`.

- A: So the `first point we'll talk about is to` use powerful language when writing. First, you must use an active voice in your writing. When you use an active voice `it takes less time for the readers to process` than when using a passive voice.

- A: Secondly, use verbs and don't `turn them into` nouns.Turning verbs into nouns will `make it harder to` `process what they are reading`. Lastly, `avoid sounding like` `you're not sure`. For example, I feel that this report could use, sounds weak. This report needs, sounds `a lot` stronger. The next point is `keep it simple`.
  
- A: The first step to keeping it simple is to `write shorter sentences`. Keep your business writing at about 8-11 words per sentence. Don't write `run-on` sentences.

- A: The second step is `get to the point`. Your first sentence should be `powerful enough` to `keep the readers intrested`. And your last sentence should `emphasize the purpose` of the letter. Now we will talk about how to write effective emails.

- A: The first step to writing effective emails is to `make your page visual`. Use lists, `headings`, `labels`, underlining, spacing and bolding to `direct the readers' eye` to important information.

- A: Make sure to always write an `attention-grabbing` subject line. Put specific information on the subject line of an email. Make sure it `cathes the readers' attention`. And remember to keep the email short and write the way you would speak. Also to `avoid puzzling readers` keep the email to one subject.

- A: Next, write a message that shows the right tone. you don't want any `misinterpretations`. Don't write anything that'll sounds like you're trying to `pick a fight with` the reader. Always remember to proofread your email. And lastly, use email shorthand. Using BTW can `shorten words` like, by the way.

- A: Well, `that's the end of` our two-part pressentation. `I hope you found this presentaiton useful` and `make sure to start using these tips` today.
