- A: As you know, I've been `put in charge of` this year's company party. `I need your help with` arranging everything.

- B: No problem. `I'm happy to lend a hand`. 

- A: Great. Now since this was just `assigned to me`, `there's still a lot of planning to do`.

- B: `No sweat`. So `what do you have in your mind`? 

- A: Well, `I was thinking about` doing a Las Vegeas theme party. 

- B: Avesome. `I'm excited aleady`! So where `were you thinking in terms of the venue`ï¼Ÿ
  
- A: I've aleady `secured that big event space up the street`. Now we just need to `find a catering to provide food and beverages`. 

- B: `I can handle that`. And `what about entertainment`? 

- A: We'll still have the usual `office raffle` and other games,but we'll need a roulette and poker table. Oh, and Byron in accounting is an Elvis impersonator, so the `music is covered`. 

- B: I'll `look into` getting those too. In the meantime, I'll send out a message to get a headcount on who's coming. `That Byron is a crazy guy`.
