- A: Hi everyone. My name is Tim, and `I'm here to` `give a presentation on` why English is important. What `comes to mind` when you `think about` English?

- B: Global language!

- C: Too difficute.

- A: Haha, that's right. `As you may know,` English is the `offical language` of over 50 countries.

- A: The `graph` on the `slide` shows that `English use` has `increased significantly` `in common careers`. `In other words`, English `opens up` many professional opportunities.

- `What' more`, even if your job doesn't require it, there are also many good reasons to learn English. Can anyone `give me an example`?

- It's useful to `travel overseas`.

- It's a great way to learn about other cultures.

- That's right. `To sum up`, English not only `boosts your career`, but also `broaden your mind`. Thank you very much. And I'm glad to `answer any questions you have`.
