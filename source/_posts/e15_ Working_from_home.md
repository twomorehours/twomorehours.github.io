- A: Jack, I heard that you're `working from home` these days.

- B: Yeah, the whole team has been `working remotely` `for a while` now.

- A: Are you `finding it easy to` adjust?

- B: Well, it's nice to `roll out of bed` `a bit later`, and not have to worry about the `commute`.

- A: No doubt! Although I can imagine it's hard to `stay productive` `all day long`. 

- B: It's easy to get distracted sure. But `I have my routine, and I stick to it`.

- A: You probably don't have to worry about your `physical appearance` though, right?

- B: I'm still dressing `as though` I were going to work. It helps me to `stay on track`.

- A: A lot of workers must `attend virtual meetings` `dressed like slobs`.

- B: At first people were `in their pajamas` and `relying on app filters`, but they're getting better.

- A: I guess `the lesson is`, don't `phone it in`, even when you're phoning it in.
