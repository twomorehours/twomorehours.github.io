- A:  I `got your email about` a new order of our cutlery brand.
- B:  `Thanks for calling so quickly`.
- A: `My pleasure`. It looks like you're `ordering in much higher volume this time, hopefully  `      `that means you were happy with the last shipment`.
- B: We loved the `cutlery sets` last time, and our client `was thrilled`. This time, we've got a `contract to outfit` all of the bistros in a hotel chain, `it's definitely a larger order`.
- A: `Sounds exciting`. Well,` we're glad you're contacting us again`, and` I want to make sure` `we can meet all of your needs`. Now, you mention that you'll need 3000 sets of knives, folks and spoons. Do you have a budget quote from the hotel? Are they looking for a `high-end` or a `more standard functional set`?
- B:  High-end. Our budget is at $40000 right now. but I was hoping we'd be able to get a `bulk-discount`.
- A:  Well, we do offer `tier-pricing`, so that's certainly `doable`. If you're ordering 3000 sets. I can actually give you a per-set price of $12, which is a 20% discount. 
- B: `That sounds fantastic`. I also wanted to `ask about payment and refund terms`. `Is it the same policy as last time`?  50% payment on `order confirmation`, and the `balance` is due within 15 days of delivery, right?   Do you still `have a 10 day return policy`?
- A:  The payment terms `are the same`, but usually for large orders likes this, we allowed an `extended` return policy of 15 days.
- B: That would `help us out`, it will take some extra time to `get every restaurant set up`, and this way if we are over on our order, `we have a little more time to adjust`. 
- A: `I understand completely`. `Now I also wanted to let you know` if you have any other needs we could certainly give you some steep `incentives` to also look at our dishware and table furnishings. If you're ordering in the same kind of volume, our tier-pricing plan could extend up to 30% on the entire order. 
- B:  Really? if we could do the entire order with you, it sounds like it would really help keep us under the budget. `I had no idea` you did this. I'm glad you rang.
-  A: Well, that's why I did sometimes, `it's better to get a little more information, because we really want to make sure we can `earn your business` and give you the best quote possible.
