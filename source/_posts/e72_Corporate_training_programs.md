- A: `My problems with` our corporate training program are `it's too inconvenient`; and it's mostly classroom-based and paper-based with only a few software programs. `That's all outdated` now. 

- B: Well, `what would you suggest`?

- A: `I recommend` an app for an iPad or iPhone. And other features like videos, links, eBooks,forums, etc. `We need a variety of reference tools to help` learners `absorb knowledge` quickly and conveniently.
  
- B: `Those are good ideas`, `especially since` not everyone learns from sitting classroom all day. We `definitely need lots of tools that'll cater to all different types of learners`. 

- A: `We've received feedback in the past about` how mundane the courses are. We have `interactive` whiteboards in our classrooms, but we aren't `taking advantage of all their capabilities`.

- A: We need to gamify some of our materials; add fun games to our whiteboards. Games will help the learners `stay engaged and stimulated`, so they can soak up the knowledge.

- B: Yes, we definitely need to get the learners engaged with the content.  `But I doubt` our instructional designers `have the skills to deliver that`. That's why I suggest we `loot at` third-party solutions.

- B: `Do you have any recommendations`?

- A: `I looked at quite a few`. There are some good solutions out there. The key is that `enhance` the learning experience and effective `track the performance`.

- B: Can they be `integrated into` our learning management system?

- A: Many can. `The implementaion doesn't seem to be that complicated`.But I will need to get IT to `take a closer look`. 

- B: `What about costs`?

- A: Many of these solutions have a subscription model. So we `pay for` the number of acounts we'd like to have. It will `give us the flexibility to run limited pilots` before `rolling it out company wide`.

- B: `Sounds like you've got a plan`. For our next meeting, `can you give me a detailed proposal to` for how you'd like to improve out training program? `We'll take it from there`. 

- A: Got it.
