- A: Ok, `here we go`. Hello everyone. Today I'm going to `explain our new sales plan`. We `have a lot of work ahead of us`. `What do you think`, Jean?

- B: You `sound too dull`. Try `sounding less monotone`. You need to have `a little more` energy. You don't `want people to think this is a somber funeral`... Also, `add a few more sentences about` the new sales plan.

- A: Ok, `I'll try it again`. Hello everyone. Today I'm going to `explain our new sales plan`. This year, `we'll concentrate on opening new markets`. We have a lot of work ahead of us,but `the most important thing is for everyone to work together`.

- B: `That's much better`. Try `accentuating your key points`, so that `your audience knows what you want them to foucus on`.

- A: Don't you think I might sound like `I'm exaggerating the key points`? `It might sound a bit inauthentic`.

- B: `Not if you do it right`. `Here let me try`. ... If you don't `make the keys points stand out`, some people might not know what your `objectives` are.

- A: Ok, `I'll try it`. ...

- B: `Excellent`.

- A: Thanks. But `that was only` the `intro`. `I still have a lot more to say`. And `I don't think I'll be able to` `remember all of this`.Do you think I could `bring this paper with me`?

- B: `That's a bad idea`.

- A: If you bring the paper, what's going to `stop you from read it verbatem`? That's not going to `keep your audience intrigued`.

- B: If you don't `show your audience that` you `value their time`, then they won't value `what you have to say`.

- A: But `what if` `I can't recall something`?

- B: Bring flash cards and only `write down` your key points. Try running `through it ` again, but this time without the paper. Remember, `practice makes perfect`.
