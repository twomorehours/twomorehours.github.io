- A: Oh, Man. `I'm doing a project with` Alys, but I'm worried, because she's `so type A`.

- B: `Isn't that a good thing`? I mean she's a `hyper-organized` `workaholic` and does everything to a T.

- A: Yeah, but because she's `overly ambitious` and a `perfectionist`, she's never `all that statisfied`. 

- B: Oh, `I see what you mean`. She's also `pretty competitive` and `doesn't accept failure very well`.
  
- A: Exactly! She's `touchy` and `so obessive`, `especially about` `time management`.

- B: Right! Since you're type B and `laid back`. `she's probably going to think` `you are a slaker`.

- A: Yeah. I mean, to be fair, `I do procrastinate`. But `at the end of the day, I do get things done`.

- B: True. Well `she may be hard to work wtih` , but she really is `proactive` and does `get results`.

- A: I know, I know. I just hope she `loosens up`.
