- A: Hi, `got a minute`? `I'm having a conflict with Mk`. `There's some tension between us`.

- B: I see. `Best to defuse that` before `it gets out of hand`, `wouldn't you say`?

- A: It already is. Every conversation about work `ends up` in an arguement.
  
- B: Well, people don't `see eye to eye`. Everyone `has different work styles`.

- A: True. I guess we should `sit down and talk it out`.

- B: Absolutely. `Listen carefully and be open`. Clarify `his perspective` instead of `assuming you know what it is`.

- A: Actually, that might help us `get to the root of the problem`.

- B: Probably. It usually ends up just being lack of communication.

- A: I'd love to `resolve his conflict quickly`. It's been affecting my work.

- B: I can imagine. Oh, and another thing: Never `take things personally`. Just `be calm` and always quick to apologize. And `mean it`.

- A: Ok, `that helps`. Thanks.
