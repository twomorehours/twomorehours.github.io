- A: Hi, Jack. We have a `store opening`, and `I'd like to go over some of the pringting details with you`.

- B: Sure Jess. Let me `get out` our product schedules for your stores and we'll go over the items. Let's start with `signage`, menus and `business cards`.

- A: Yes, that's right. First I `have a question about` the `delivery schedule`. We're `looking to` `roll this out` `as soon as possible`. Can you `have everything done` in a week?

- B: No problem, Jess. After you `give us the green light` for signage installation, we'll need `two days for processing`, and one day for installation. We'll `start on` the menu printing and the business card printing right now, and then `they'll be ready` `at the same time as the signs`.

- A: Actually, our `corporate branding` `has changed slightly`, so we may need to do `a small redesign`. The marketing department is `going for` a border style, so all the black and white text is `inverted`. Also, our font has changed, and our logo is just one color now.

- B: Ok. Please `ask your design department to` send us `a copy` of the new elements and we'll `drop it into` your files. We can `work up a proof` and send it to you by tomorrow morning.

- A: `That should be fine`, Jack. Will this `affect our dealines`?

- B: After the proof `is approved` and you `tell us to begin work`, the deadlines `will be the same`, that is, if the quantities haven't changed. How many signs do you need?

- A: At this store, we'll need three. We're expecting `higher volume` at this location, so we'd like to double `the quantity` for the menus. The number of the business card should `stay about the same`, though.

- B: `Looks like that's all the information we need`. We'll `get started on this tight away`.
