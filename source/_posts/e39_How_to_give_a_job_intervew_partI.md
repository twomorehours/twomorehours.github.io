- A: Hi Liam, `do you have tips on` giving an interview in English? `I don't have much expeirence` as an interviewer.

- B: Oh, of course. Do you want `pointers on` how to `structure conversation`.

- A: `That'll be very helpful`! `I just get so nervous` when I am speaking in English.

- B: `That's totally natural`, which is why it's helpful to `make an outline` for the interview.

- A: Should I `write a script`?

- B: No, I just `divide the interview into sections` and `write down` a few useful phrases `for each`.

- A: Ok, what about starting the interview with some `small talk`?

- B: Sure. `Friendly ice-breakers are always nice.` You want to be professional, but You also want the interviewee to `feel at ease`.

- A: Got it. Any other tips I should know `for the time being`?

- B: Actually, `I've got some more`. We can `go over` those later `if you want`.
