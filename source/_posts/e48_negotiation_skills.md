- A: Good afternoon everyone. Today `we'll be talking about` `negotiation styles`. The negotiation skills used depends on the context and the interests of the other party as well as `other factors`.

- A: First, I'd like to introduce the `accommodating style`. Individuals who have this leadership style like `solving problems` the other party has and `they tend to preserve their personal relationships`. An accommondator tends to `be sensitive to` the emotional state,` body language`, and `verbal cues` of the other parties.

- A: Next, we have the avoiding style. These individuals don't like to negotiate. When they are negotiating ,they tend to `dodge the confrontational aspects` of the negotiating.

- A: Third, we have the collaborating style. These individuals enjoy solving aduous problems. They tend to be good at using negotiations to `understand the concerns` and interests of the other parties.

- A: Fourth, we have the competing style. In this style, individuals enjoy negotiation process because they enjoy competing and winning. These individuals often` neglect the importance of` the relationships.

- A: Lastly, we have the `compromissing style`. These individuals who use the style are usually `eager to` `close the deal`.they do so `by compromissing` fairly and equally. 

- A: Now, we'll talk about types of negotiators. While I talk about these types of negotiators, `keep in mind` what negotiation style they `are likely to use`. So,let's look at three basic types of negotiator.

- A: First , we have the soft `bargainers`. they tend to be gentle when bargaining. These negotiators usually `yield to` what the other party wants. They try to `avoid confrontation` and like to `maintain a sloid friendship with` the other party. 

- A: The second type of the negotiator is the hard bargainer. These individuals use `contentious strategies` to influence. They use the phrase such as this is `my final offer`, and `take it or leave it`. They see others as adversaries and their goal is victory. `They are obstinate and stick to one single thing to be agreed on`.

- A: The third type of negotiator is the principled negotiator. These individuals tend to look at an `integrative solution`. They focus on the problem rather than the `intentions`, `motives` and `needs` of the people involved.

- A:` That's it for` negotiation styles.
