- A: I finally `bit the bullet` and did it, Bill.

- B: `Let me guess`, Peter, `you resigned`?

- A: Yep, I `quit my job`. I was just `tired of` being overworked and `underpaid`.

- B: Yeah, you didn't have `much of a life` after you started working at that software firm. 

- A: No `work-life balance` at all. Plus, I didn't `receive any recognition` for my `hard work`.

- B: That will `make you unappreciated and unfufilled for sure`. So how did you resign? You didn't `make a secen`, I hope.

- A: Oh no. `I was super professional about it`. I just `politely` told the boss I had something to talk about, `at her convenience`, of course.

- B: So `how did she take the news`?

- A: She `seemd ok about the whole thing`; there wasn't any `hard feelings`. And I just gave `my two weeks' notice`, `that was it`.

- B: `Freedom at last`.
