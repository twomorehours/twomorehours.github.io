- A: Yeah, I `find living here more convinient` than back in the West.

- B: `Tell me about it`. China is really beginning to `grow on` me. `I could see myself` living here.
  
- A: Well, if you're `serious about it`, we do `have some openings` at our company.

- B: `Sounds intriguing`, but `I've got a good thing going` back home. So, `how long have you been` `in the industry`?

- A: My parents `started the company` `when I was just a child`. `Naturally`, I just `followed in their footsteps`.

- B: I see. So you must `know the ins and outs` `better than anyone`.

- A: `More or less`. But `as you know`, `the industry is changing so fast`, you have to `refresh your knowledge` and `keep innovating` in order to `stay in the game`.

- B: Absolutely. `Things are changing so fast`, and `it really keeps you on your toes`.

- A: Yeah, `the competition is fierce` `in this part of the world`, which I believe only `pushes us to do better`.

- B: `cheers to that`.
