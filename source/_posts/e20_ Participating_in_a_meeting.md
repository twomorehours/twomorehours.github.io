- A: Ok, everyone. In today's meeting, `I'd like to` discuss `promoting English learning` at the office. Annie,` where do you stand on this`?

- B: Personally, `I'm all for it`. I think we should `introduce videos` that will `engage` the staff and help ease fears over communication problems with clients.

- A: Ok, and `what's your take on this` Keith?

- C: Well, I think Annie `made an excellent suggestion`, but I think videos are `a bit passive`. They can `teach us expressions`, but we `need more real application`.

- A: OK, I can see where you're coming from but `what would you suggest`?

- C: `One option is to` add online chats and `quzzies` with department competitions. A little friendly competiton can increase interest and `motivation`.

- B: `I see where you're going with this`. We can even give a small reaward to the `winning ` department.

- A: Well, `It's certainly a good idea`. I'll `pass it along`, and `see what head office says`.
