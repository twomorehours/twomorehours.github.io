- A: So, L. Let's talk about our new `sales rep`, Jason.

- B: Sure, `what's up`?
  
- A: Basically, `I'm having concerns about` his performance. `He doesn't seem to` `be a good fit`.

- B: Really? `What makes you say that?` `He seems pretty competent`.

- A: I feel he's `unreliable`, sometimes `he is very productive`, but `other times` he `lacks focus`.

- B: `Could you be more specific`?

- A: Sure. `Take last Tuesday for instance`. He `fell asleep` in our morning meeting.

- B: `That's not very professional`. He's usually `full of energy`.

- A: He's also `missed a few deadlines`. `The bottom line is` `he needs to change`.

- B: Ok, I'll `bring it up with` him and try to `coach` him.
