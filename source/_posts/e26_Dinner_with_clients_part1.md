- A: You really `chose a fine establishment for` dinner, Li. `The decor is beautiful` and the meau looks like it has some great `vegerarian` options, `I'm impressed`.

- B: `I'm glad you like it` `so far`, Jordan. The design here has `nice mix of classic and contemporary`. But I `mostly` chose the place because you said you aren't a big `meat eater`.
  
- A: Wow, `I said that months ago`. `You've got a good memory`.

- B: I just try to `pay attention to detail`. Hey, how about `a glass of wine`?

- A: Sure, what would pair `well with` what we're ordering. China `has so many flavors to offer`, and `I'm still such a newbie`.

- B: Oh, `that's your first time` in China. See, my memory is not that good. So `how do like it so far`? `By the way,` I think `any of these whites would be good`.

- A: It's been `fantastic`. I feel like `you're light years ahead of` us: the `high speed railway`, the whole `mobile payment` thing. It seems like `anything can be done at the touch of a phone` here. 

- B: Well, I'm spending a lot of time on `low-level tasks`, which is `keeping me from the more impactful things`. I feel like I can `add more value to` the company, if `those tasks were done by someone more junior`.

- A: Yeah, I `find living here more convininet` that `back` in the West.
