- A: Kyle, `I'm sorry to have to tell you that` `we're letting you go`. Your last performance review have not been `up to the par` and we feel that `you're not a good fir for the position`. `Your employment will terminate` at the end of the month.

- B: `You can't be serious`. I've been working really hard lately. Yesterday, I even `stayed overtime` to go over the Richter account. `I can't believe this is happening`.

- A: `I understand that you feel that way`, but `the decision is final`.
  
- B: You know, I've `handed in all reports on time`, and I've `made a lot of effort` to `fit in here`. `It's just not fair`. 

- A: I know that moving into our department last year `has been a diffcult adjustment for you`. We just haven't seen you put as much effort as we would have liked into `becoming part of our team`. We do appreciate your years of service, and will be giving you a `severance package`. Your final `paycheck` will be given to you at the end of the month.

- B: What about all my vacation and benefits? 

- A: Your final paycheck will include you `accrued` vacation and sick days. And here is a packet from HR exlaining your options for continued health care coverage. Do you have any questions?

- B: Yes, `does everyone know this is happening?`

- A: No, but we have asked Julia to help you `complete your reports` by the end of this month. And julia will `tie up the loose ends` on your other projects.

- B: What about me? `Do I have a say` in any of this? 

- A: Yes, we'd like to `set up` an exit interview with you before you leave. You've `been with our organization a long time` and we would be instrested in hearing your feedback. `It's been a pleasure` working with you these past few weeks. `I wish you all the best for the future`.
