- Ok, `moving on` to the `bedroom` `furniture`. Let's get a `king size` bed! 

- `That's way` too big. A `queue size` would be `more than enough`. Let's `go with` the same `color scheme` as the `living room` `furniture`.

- Ok, ok. How about this one with a `bed frame` and `storage boxes` `underneath`?

- It's nice. Do you want to `go with` a `headboard`? It'll be more `comfy`.

- `That's true`. `What about` the `mattress`? I remember you wanted to get it `somewhere else`.

- Yes, I found a great place for `quality matresses` `at bargin prices`. We can go there in the afternoon.

- Ok. Well, we've got a `walk-in closet` `built in`. So there is no need for `wardrobes`. I think `that's it for` the bedroom.

- `you're forgetting` `nightstands` and a `dressing table`.

- What? Oh, `that's right`. Well we'll just get the `matching` `nightstands` with the bed. And who use a `dressing table` `nowadays`?

- `It'll be` really `handy`! I can have all `my makeup` and `jewelry` `within` `easy reach`.

- Where are you `going to` `put it`? I think `the bedroom` will be really `croweded`.

- It doesn't `take up` `much space` `at all`. `Besides` I've always wanted my own dressing table `ever since` I was a little girl. And we won't have to `fight for` the bath room mirror in the morning. You know I need time to `do my makeup`.

- `Alright`, alright. `Point taken`.
