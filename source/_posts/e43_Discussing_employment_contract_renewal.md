- B: `To be perfectly honest`, I believe `I'm worth much more than that`.

- A: `Could you be more specific`?

- B: As you may know, I've `taken on many additional responsibilities`, and have consistently `demonstrated results`.

- A: `You certainly have`.

- B: And `on that note`, I should tell you I have receive some very generous offers from a few firms.

- A: How generous `are we talking about here`?

- B: They are offering `a better incentive structure` and `a wider range of perms`.

- A: Frankly, `I'm not sure` how flexible we can be `in terms of the compensation`.
