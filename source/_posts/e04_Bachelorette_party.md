- Hey, Zoe, did you get the `invite for` Mia's `bachelorette party`?

- I did. Is it a `one-day` thing or a `weekend geteway`?

- It's a `three-day trip to` Vegas. So, We'll go the `casino`, `hit the clue` ,and `watch a show` `or two`.

- `Sounds like` we're `going all out`. `Hope` we won't be too `hungover`.

- Well, `What happens in` Vegas, `stays in` Veges.

- True! Do we have a theme?

- Yeah, we might `do a black and white theme` with the `bride-to-be` in white.

- Great! `Nothing tacky then`. Is everyone `pitching in for` the Mia's flight?

- No! Just the `bridesmaids`. The other girls doesn't have to.

- Cool! So, I'll `see you in Vegas then`.

- Yeah, I'll see you in Vegas.
