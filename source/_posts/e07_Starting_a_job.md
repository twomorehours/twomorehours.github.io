- A: Hey, Bill. This is Julie. She's our new senior web developer.

- B: Oh, hi. Greate to meet you. I'm Bill.

- C: Julie. Thanks. I'm really `looking forward to` `getting settled in` here. 

- A: Julie `used to` work at Hooli, and did some great work there.

- C: It was a great place to work, `but more of` `a springboard to` something like this.

- B: Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. We're pretty spoiled here.

- C: Yeah, relocating is tough. But It's nice to ba at a company that's `invested in` their staff.

- A: That must be tough. But everybody's inclusive here, I'm sure you'll `fill right in`.

- B: I agree. Everybody was super accommodating when I first `came onboard`.

- C: That's so great to hear. I've heard some horror stories about the work environment at some firms.

- A: `Nothing like that here`. Say, Bill and I `were thinking of` `hitting up` the new `food chunk` for lunch. Want to `tag along`?

- C: Oh thanks. `I'm up for` that.
