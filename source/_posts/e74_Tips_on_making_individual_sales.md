We `rely on` experience, `insight` and creativity when deciding where to go, who to see and when to `follow up`. So planning `is incredibly important to us`. A personal sales plan can `be your roadmap to success`. An individual sales plan isn't `as fancy and comlicating as it sounds`; `it's actually quite simple`.

But be as realistic as possible in your forecast. If you have to, use your recent revenue history as a guide. It's important to create new opportunities for yourself in the future and give you some goals.

So don't `lose sight of the big picture`. Long-term profitability, sustainbility, and `compitability` are important factors when qulifying leads and busilding your business.

Thank you for joining me remember, `the bottom line is that` without a well-out personal sales plan, `you're always a step behind those competitiors who are already prepared`. `This can be an invaluable tool` that assists in increasing your sales, driving higher net profits and earning your take-home pay.
