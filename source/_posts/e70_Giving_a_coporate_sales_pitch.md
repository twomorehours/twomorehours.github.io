- A: Good morning everyone. `I'm glad to see you all here`.  All right, `in today's seminar`, we are going to cover a topic that is quite common `in this industry`. `Sales pitches`.

- A: Now, `you may be the brightest individual with the best idea or product to sell`, but `when it comes to` selling and pitching prosopects, `it really can be quite a challenge`. Where do you start, how do you approach the prospect and what is the first thing you say? Today, we will talk about how you can confidently `make a sales pitch` and `eliminate common errors`. 

- A: An effective pitch begins way before the actual meeting with the buyer.You must `be prepared for your own task`. What is it that you want?  `Start with one simple goal and don't set the bar too high`.
  
- A: Another important part of your preparation is to answer the questions: What do you want? `What do they expect`? You `need to figure out exactly how your idea or product is fit for their mission`.

- A: Knowledge about your product and the `benefits` that it gives to the customer will give you full confidence that you really know what you are talking about. This added handle objections effectively and not `let the sales just slip away`.

- A: Now, `greeting a client should be a simple thing`, right? Well `losing control of your conversation at the very beginning will most likely affect the outcome of` your pitch. So it is very important.

- A: `We're used to hearing that` using ma'am and sir is the polite and respectful approach. However, `it's better to` greet to a prospect by their name or title. Simply Good morning Mrs X ot mR X. `It makes thing much simpler`. `When I hear` some calling me sir, I immediately `assume` they want to sell me something and `I almost instantly put my guard up`.

- A: Next, always remember to `make a two-way conversation`, not a lecture. `Don't talk endlessly`, and then ask are you intrested? From a `customer's point of view`, it seems you really don't `care about` what the customer needs and all you wnat is your own selfish gain.  So instead, `consult with the customer` and ask question about their intrests and their past experinces.

- A: Finally, you need to `close the deal`. Once you finish your pitch and consult with the client, you run through the benefits of what you are selling and the solutions it will provide `the needs the coustomer has expressed`.

- A: Tell them that you'll `take care of the follow-up`, make the needed contacts, send the necessary information whatever needs to be done. All they should have to do is say yes. Regardless of their initial response, be sure to make a smooth exit, and don't `overstay your welcome`.

- A: `As soon as you get back to your home` or your office, write a handwritten thank you note to the buyer and drop it to the mail. `This means much more than` email these days.

- A: Many people believe that a good idea will sell itself. But that's not how goods are sold. packing and presentation matter. `It's the same for an idea or new product`, `no matter how great it is`.
