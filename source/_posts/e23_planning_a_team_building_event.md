- A: Hey Rf, did you hear? We have a `team building event` with the new employees `next week`.

- B: Yeah, `I got the memo`. I hope you're ready for some `tug of war` and `paintballing`.

- A: Oh, `I'm bringing my A game`. So `the real question is` are you ready? 

- B: `To hear you talk like that`, `let's just say` I hope we're `on the same team`. `Either way`, I' really looking forward to `socializing with everyone`.

- A: Me too. I also think it is a great opportunity to boost `our teamwork skills`.

- B: Likewise. Competing with each other will `help us bond` and `build team spirit` that `we can later use` in the office.

- A: `Definitely`. We will learn more about each other's `strengths, weaknesses and interests`, which is vital for `collaborating on projects`.

- B: Yeah, and `it's cool that we get to do so` `in a fun, carefree manner` `outside the office`.
