- A: Zack, `what do you think about` our `turnover` numbers?

- B: Well `it's definitely something we need to deal with`. At the moment, we have 30% turnover rate. We need to `find out what we are doing wrong`,so that we can `retain` more of our `desirable` employees.

- A: Were you able to `go through` the exit interview feedback? 

- B: Yes, I found `various reasons for` our former `employees's decision to` leave the company. `I've grouped them into three categories`. First `we have the group of people` who left `due to` a notoriously bad manager. 

- B: Then we have the group of people who left the company because ` there was no room for growth` in the company. And lastly, we have the group of people who left for `unspecified reasons`.

- A: Ok, were you able to `categrize the former employees as` desirable or undesirable employees?  
  
- B: Yes, `I managed to do that`.A large number of our former employees were categorized as desirable employees. `That means we need to start looking into` how to keep those employees. 

- A: Ok. Well. you mentioned previously some of your exiting employees`weren't happy with their managers`. `We need to make sure` our managers `are qulified and fit for the job`. They need to `reinforece open communication, provide meaningful feedback and inspire employees to work together`.

- B: `I'll look at ways of` `helping them become more effective` managers and we can discuss it `during our next meeting`.

- A: Ok, Now, `what do you think we can do` `about the lack of growth` within our company?

- B: Well, the exit interview feedback `tells us` that part of the problem is `job statisfaction`. People didn't `find pride in the work` they were doing, nor could `they see how their current position progress into higher one`. I think we need to `articulate` a career path for our emplyees, and `work on` adding more career opportunities within our compnay. 

- A: Yeah, `I like that idea`. What about motivation?

- B: `That's another issue`. Our `current compensation` structure doesn't really `reflect the performance`. Money wasn't the number one issue `pertaining to retention`, but it `has a big impact` when it's `seen as` a merit-based.

- A: Ok, we could `look into` changing that.

- B: Lastly, we should also `focus on` the `recruitment process` to ensure that our potential employees have the right job fit with the posistion.

- A: Yeah, I agree. We `thought of some really good ideas`. How about we `head out` to lunch and `continue where we left off`, after.
