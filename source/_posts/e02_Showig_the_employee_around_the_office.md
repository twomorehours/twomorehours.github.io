- Hey, David. Welcome to your first day on the job. Let me `show you around` and `get you settled in`.

- Thanks, Phyllis. This is a beautiful workspace.

- We feel that open office encourages `creativity` and `collaboration`.

- `That's so true`. How many floors do we have?

- There are two floors. `On the first floor is the reception`. Admin is also on the same floor, Sales and marketing are on the second floor.

- Do I need a `key card` to come in?

- Yes. You'll need it to `access` elevators and diffrent parts of the bullding.

- `I see`. So, Where will I be working?

- You're `on the second floor`. But `take a look at` the common room first.

- Sure. Wow, It looks so `inviting`.

- Yeah, It's a great place to relax and `chat with coworkers`. Now, `let me show you to` your desk.

- Sounds good.
