- A: Hi, Mark. `Have you started palnning` next year's seminar?

- B: Sure have. But I might `need some directions from you`.

- A: No problem. `Before you even begin`, contact the `venue` and make sure `the dates are available`.

- B: Right. I'll `get that done` today.

- A: After `that's taken care of`, we need find a `keynote speaker`.

- B: Got it. I've got `a shortlist` of speakers here. And I'll` put out an ad for` `event staff`.

- A: Great! And don't forget to `apply for` our `event permits` well `in adavance`.

- B: `Sure thing`! Can we start looking for a caterer `after that`?

- A: Yep! Once we have the `essentitals` `in place`, we can do that, as well as set up a marketing campaign.

- B: Sounds good.
