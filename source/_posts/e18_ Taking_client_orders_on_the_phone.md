- A: Good afternoon, Office Supplies Wholesalers. `Amy speaking`.

- B: Hi, Amy. This is Charles from ATI technology. I'd like to `place an order`.

- A: Sure. I'm just `bringing up` your accout in our system. Oh, `It says` we `made a delivery` just last week.

- B: Yeah, this is `a busy time of` year. We're `running low on` paper, I need 5 more boxes.

- A: Would you like to buy `printer ink` too? We have a `30% off promotion` `right now`.

- B: Yeah, I better `stock up`, just `to be safe`. Send 4 `packs of` those too, please.

- A: Okay, I've added those to your `purchase`. `Is there anything else I can help you with`?

- B: Ah, `one more thing`. Can you `make it a rush delivery`? It's `crucial` I receive it before the weekend.

- A: `No problem`. `It'll arrive in` two business days. I'll send an `invoice` to your email.

- B: Thanks for your help, Amy. Bye.
