- A: Matt, could I `speak to you` `privately` `for a minute`?

- B: Sure. Anna, `what's it about`?
  
- A: `Please dont take this the wrong way`. But `I've noticed that` you haven't really been in `top form` `at work` `lately`.

- B: Ah, I'm really glad you `brought that up`, because `I am indeed having some challenges` at work.

- A: Ok, `do you mind sharing those with me`?

- B: Certainly. My `workload` has increased significantly as `our business has been growing`. I'm really excited about the new opportunities. But `at the same time` I'm `struggling to keep up`.

- A: Matt, I really `appreciate you stepping up` as we grow. Now, `how can I help and make things more easier for you`?

- B: Well, I'm spending a lot of time on `low-level tasks`, which is `keeping me from the more impactful things`. I feel like I can `add more value to` the company, if `those tasks were done by someone more junior`.

- A: Um, `I do agree with you`. At this moment, `we don't have the people to support` you. But I'll make sure to `bring the issue up` at next management meeting and `push for more resources` for the team.

- B: Thanks Anna! `I appreciate it`.

- A: No problem. `In the meantime`, if `I can help with anything that you're working on`, please `let me know`.

- B: Thank you. `I'll do my best to keep up`.
