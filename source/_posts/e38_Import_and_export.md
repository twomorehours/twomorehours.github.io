- A: Hey, STN. `It's been a while`. `How've you been`?

- B: Oh, `I just landed a job at an export trading company`. I'm finally `putting my degree to good use`. 

- A: Oh, `that's great`. So, you're `handling the logistics` of selling products overseas, right?

- B: It `has to do with` that, but you might `be thinking of` `export management company`?

- A: Oh, `I didn't realize` `there was a difference`.

- B: Yeah, EMCs are hired by domestic companies to do their exporting work for them, like hiring dealers, invoicing customers and distributors, handling marketing, and `overseeing` shipping.

- A: Oh, wow, that's `a ton of` work. How do they `pull all that off`?

- B: Well, they usually `specialize` by product or foreign market. And `in some cases`, they even take the title to the goods.

- A: Ok, `that makes sense`, but `how is that different from` what you do? 

- B: Well, ETCs don't `start with` mechandise to sell. They start by `looking at foreign markets to see` what consumers want to buy.

- A: Ah, `I think I got it`. Then they `hunt down` the domestic companies that `make those products`. 

- B: `You got it`.

- A: I think `your job sounds more fun`.
