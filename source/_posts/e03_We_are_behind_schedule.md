- Okay, before we `wrap up` the metting, Sophie, can you `bring me up to speed on `the `annual report`? 

- Well, we're actually `bedind schedule`. We `ran into an issue` with some of the sales numbers.

- Hmm, `we'd better` get those numebrs right. Do we have to `push back` the dealine again?

- It's going to be `tight`, but I don't think I can get it done `any faster`.

- We can't `afford to` `delay the report` `any longer`. Have you asked others to help you?

- I've alreay `asked around`, but everyone's `pretty occupied`.

- Let me `take care of` that, I'll `assign` someone to `help you out`.

- Thanks, Kevein. That'll help us `get back on schedule`.

- These hiccups are `slowing things down` and we really need to `make the deadline`.
