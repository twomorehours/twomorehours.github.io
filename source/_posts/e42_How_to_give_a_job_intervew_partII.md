- A: Hi,Grace.`How's the interview prep coming along`?

- B: Well, all right, but `I'm not quite sure` how to `phrase` the these interview questions?

- A: Well, first of all, you want them to `keep them open-ended` to give the interviewees a chance to `elaborate`.

- B: Ok, so avoid those `yes or no questions`.

- A: Exactly. `One way is to` `ask for specific examples` of when they solved a problem or `took the initiative`.

- B: All right, `sounds easy enough`. Should I ask a few `situational questions` too?

- A: Sure. You can always `start by` saying "`How would you response if ..`" and `continue from there`.

- B: Ok, but `what should I do` if the interviewee doesn't answer the question directly.

- A: Well, you can always ask them to `expand` , or you can `rephrase` that questions later.

- B: Ok, got it. `Thanks for all the great tips`.
