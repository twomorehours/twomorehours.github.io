- A: Hi Ella, `could I have a word with you`?

- B: Of course. `What would you like to discuss`?
  
- A: Well,it's about `your performance`. I `couldn't help but` notice that your report `have been a bit late`.

- B: Yes. `Sorry about that`, `There was some confusion` `regarding` `the new timeline`, so `it took longer than usual`.

- A: `I see`. Well `next time`, please `clarify the dealines`, and `adjust accordingly`.

- B: `Absolutely`. `I'll make sure it doesn't happen again`.

- A: `Alright`. But `to be frank`, I've also noticed `an increasing amount of errors`.

- B: Yes. About that... `the workload has been a little heavy` this month, but `I'll make sure to be more thorough` next time.

- A: Alright, sounds good. `That's it for today`, but `let me know if you have any concerns`.

- B: `Will do`. And `thanks for taking the time to `talk with me today. I appreciate the feedback.
