- A: Hey, Stanly. Can you give me some pointers on how to t`ake meeting notes`?

- B: No problem, Andrea. `Where do you feel you have trouble`?

- A: Well, `for one thing`, I `feel like just cramming`.

- B:I say you need to be `better prepared`. `Make a schedule for` `turning in the notes`. `Summarizing them` and `sending them out` `right after` the meeting `is the best`.

- A:Ok, will do. I also `have trouble being concise`.

- B:Notes are `all about being` concise. Use a clear-cut format. Only include the important information and a`ction items`, not `every detail`.

- A: Got it. `Any other advice`?

- B: Yes, Know the `purpose of the meeting`. It `goes hand in hand with` being prepared.

- A: Good point. `Is it ok to` `ask for` the `clarification` if I `missed some information`?

- B: Absolutely! And always include the `next steps` and deadlines.

- A: This has been really helpful. Thanks for all the tips.

- B: `Anytime`!
