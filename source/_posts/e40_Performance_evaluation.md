- A: Did you get a chance to read the results of your `online performance evaluation`?

- B: I did, but I noticed `a large discrepency betwwen` the socres I gave and the ones you did.

- A: Yes, I saw that you gave yourself `a score of "exceed expectaions"` `several times`.

- B: And I noticed that I was given a `"meets expections"` for things like client statisfication.

- A: While the clients generally `praise your professionalism`, we still see `a lot of room for improvement`.

- B: I guess `I see myself as someone who` handles client problems effectively.

- A: `You certainly do`. But in order to exceed expectaions, you need to `go above and beyond` for the client.

- B: So `you're saying` I need to `anticipate` problems instead of just `reacting to them`.

- A: Yes, and `that's what we'd like to see` `going forward`.

- B: Okay, thanks for the `constructive feedback`.

- A: My pleasure. `If you want anything , my door is always open`.
