My name is Yuhao, you can find the other base information about me from the resume, 
Let's start with my work experience directly. 
I have worked for two companies in the past four and a half years. The first one is 58 Group.
I participated in the development of KGDC there. The second company is Zhangyue, which is the second biggest reading servie provider in China. Most of the ebook apps released by
domestic mobile phone manufactures are supported by this company, such as huawei, oppo and vivo.  These two companies are both in the Internet industry. 
So I'm on top of the agile development, and they also have huge number of users, 
especially for Zhangyue. It has more than 100 million users at least and most of them are active.
So I have accumulated a lot of experience on high avaiable and high concurrency.
I specialize in Java and Golang. I have wealth experience in using Spring Stack and Some middlewares.
I can slove most of problems in terms of them in a short time. I have been maintaining a blog, you can find something
I learned and thought about over there. The reason which explains I participate in this interview today
is releated with my family. I had a daughter last year, so I need to get back home to spend more time with her.
That's all for my self-introduction, Thank you.
