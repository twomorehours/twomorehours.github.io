- A: Hey, Michael, I heard you `have a disagreement with` Pam `the other day`. `What happened`? 

- B: Oh, let's just say Pam isn't `a big fan of` mime.

- A: But you are so `likable`. `How could that be`?

- B: `Apparently`, she thinks I'm `pushy` and `bossy`.

- A: Oh well, she's `flaky`.  Say, `I've always wondered`, do you have a favorite coworker?

- B: `Other than you`, Emilly? `I'd have to say` Jim. He's always so `enthusiastic`. `How about you`?

- A: Yeah, that Jim is a really `team player`. `As for me`, I `get along well with` Kelly.


- B: Kelly is really `warm and personable` , `which is why` we have her in customer service.

- A: Agreed. `I'd even say` she's the most `attentive` employee at the company.

- B: `Sounds like`  we may have a new employee of the month.
