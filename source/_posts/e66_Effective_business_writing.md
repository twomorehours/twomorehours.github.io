- A: `Welcome to today's seminar on` Effective Business Writing. This is a two-part presentation and tommorrow we'll continue with part two... Well, `I'm Diana from` the Economics Department at JR University. `In today's seminar` , `I will teach ways of writing` simple and short emails, letters proposals, etc.

- A: `Nowadays`, `information moves at the speed of light` through email. People `don't have time to` read email `word for word`. So `we have to change the way` we write in a business environment.

- A: First, I want to talk about the reader. `Take time to` `tailor your writing` for your audience. `In the outline you have on this talk` you'll see all the different personality types and learning styles. Study them and write `based on those theories`. Next, I'll talk about nine strategies that `will improve your business writing`.

- A: The Shirtsleeve strategies `are broken down into nine parts`. The first strategy is to use short and `familier words`. Write in`a clear and concise manner`. ` Don't use convoluted words to impress your reader`.

- A: The second strategy is to `get rid of` `redundent words and phrase`. Redandent words are often used in `everyday language`. `One example of` an everyday redandency is Free Gifts. A gift is always free and if it's not free then it's not a gift. The word Gifts `is enough to convey the meaning`. 

- A: The third strategy is `eliminate wordy language`. An example of a time-waster is on a daily basis. Daily just `works as well as` on a daily basis.
  
- A: The fourth strategy is to `avoid unnecessary fomalities`. Write in a `conversational tone,` dont't `write anything you wouldn't say` `in person`.

- A: Strategy number five is to `write in a positive tone`. People `respond better` when written to in a positive tone. `negetivity can cause reader opposition`.

- A: The sixth strategy is `to be specific`. Terms `that are vague can cuase confusion instead of giving reader percise information`.

- A: The seventh strategy is to avoid `jargon`. Uncommon jargon can be `unfamiliar to the reader` and `result in consusion`. 

- A: The eighth strategy is to make items parallel. When writing is parallel,  readers `absorb information more rapidly` and `have more clarity`.

- A: The ninth strategy is to `keep terms consistent`. Changing `terminology` can lead to confusion. Ok,`that's it for` the Shirsleeve Strategies and the end of today's presentation. Remember, the second part of this seminar is tommorrow at 8 o'clock. `Thank you and are there any questions`?
