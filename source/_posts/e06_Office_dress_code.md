- Hey, Julie. Can you `help me out with` the `office dress code` here? I think I'm a bit `underdessed`.

- Oh, don't worry. We are `full-on casual` here, so `denim` and `shorts` are fine, even the `hoodies`. And `collared shirts` are optional. Just make sure it's `neat` and clean.

- `That's what I thought`. But then I saw some people `in the lobby` wearing full siuts. 

- Well, it really depends on your `job function`. People int the client and `customer-facing` positions still need to wear `business formal attire`, or `smart casual` at least.

- Uh, so we can wear whatever we want.

- Haha, `not quite`. `Our policy is to be` comfortable and `express your own personal style`, but `within reason`.

- Make senses, so nothing too `edgy` or `revealing`?

- Yeah. I wouldn't roll in to work wearing `gym shorts` and a `sleeveless`.

- Haha, `got it`.
